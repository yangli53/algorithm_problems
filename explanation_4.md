### Design

To achieve sorting the array in a single traversal, I will keep track of 0's and 2's postions and place them in the correct positions. This will automatically result in placing 1 in the correct postions.  

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(n) because it takes one traversal to execute the function which is linear search.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(n) because it needs to store the whole list.
